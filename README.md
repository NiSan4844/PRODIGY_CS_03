# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This project is a simple Python tool that assesses the strength of a password based on several criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users about the strength of their chosen passwords.

## Features

- Evaluates passwords based on the following criteria:
  - Minimum length of 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one digit
  - At least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)
- Provides feedback on the strength of the password:
  - Very Strong
  - Strong
  - Moderate
  - Weak

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required; the tool uses built-in libraries.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-strength-tool.git
   cd password-strength-tool
   ```

2. Run the tool:

   ```bash
   python password_strength_tool.py
   ```

3. Input your password when prompted.

4. The tool will assess the password and display a strength score along with feedback.

## Example

When you run the tool, you may see output like this:

```
Enter your password: P@ssw0rd123
Password Strength Score: 5/5
Your password is very strong!
```

## Future Improvements

- **Password Suggestions**: Implement a feature that suggests improvements for weak passwords.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a GUI to make the tool more user-friendly.
- **Password Breach Check**: Integrate an API to check if the password has been compromised in known data breaches.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize strength criteria based on their preferences.
- **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
